{"name":"Simulation of the dynamics fire for an urban road tunnel","tagline":"","body":"Simulation of the dynamics fire for an urban road tunnel with a legth equal to or less than 1000 meters and more than 200 meters using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). \r\n\r\n[Fire Dynamics Simulator](https://github.com/xancandal/fds-smv) is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of fire-driven fluid flow. The software solves numerically a form of the Navier-Stokes equations appropriate for low-speed, thermally-driven flow, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.\r\n\r\nThe object is to discuss the real implementation of the ventilation in case of fire as a result of the application of the main european and international safety guidelines,\r\n\r\n- Centre d´Études des Tunnels (CETU), “Guide to Road Tunnel Safety Documentation - Booklet 4: Specific Hazard Investigations”, Ministère de l´Équipement, des Transports, de lÁménagement du territoire, du Tourisme et de la Mer.
